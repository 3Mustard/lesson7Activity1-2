# Problem 1

Create two public classes: Mammal and Bird. Each should inherit from the Animal class shown below.

For each new class, override the GiveBirth method to produce the following output:

For the Mammal class, the method should return: "I give live birth"

For the Bird class, the method should return "I lay eggs"

# Problem 2

Given the Bird class below, construct the base class Animal from which it inherits.

For the Animal class, you will need:

A default constructor.

A constructor that accepts values for its two string properties: name and birthMethod.

A public method named GiveBirth (no parameters) that returns the value of the birthMethod property (a string).
